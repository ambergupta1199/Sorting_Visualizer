# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a fun React based web app that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work. Users can watch these algorithms sort data in real time, step by step. The app lets users control the speed of the sorting process and provides simple explanations of how each algorithm works, making it a great tool for learning about sorting in an easy-to-understand way.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms & Their Time Complexity**: bubbleSort,
      insertionSort,
      selectionSort,
      mergeSort,
      quickSort,
      radixSort,
      heapSort,
      countingSort,
      combSort,
      shellSort,
      gnomeSort,
      bogoSort

- **Live Visualization**: Live Visualization: Watch the sorting process in action with bars depicting each element that show how the algorithm works.

- **Simple Explanation**: As you watch the sorting, youâ€™ll also get an easy-to-understand explanation of how the algorithm works.

- **Algorithm Comparison**: You can compare the time and space complexity of different sorting algorithms to see how they perform.
